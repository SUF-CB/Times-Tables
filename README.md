# How to Clone and Run the Prime Number Program 
For users who are new to visitng this repository, there is a step by step guide below on how to clone and run this program:
1) First of all, stay on this repository and click on the "prime number.py" file and then  highlight the code and clone the code.

2) Next, you need install and Idle to paste the code and then run the program. 

3) To do this you go onto this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on download Python 3.9.

4) After Python 3.8.3 is downloaded on your device, go onto your desktop and click on "IDLE (Python 3.9 64-bit)".

5) Once this has opened up you can then paste the prime number program from the prime number.py file.

6) Before you run the code, Save the file with any name of your choice.

NOTE: Make sure the file type is ".py" after you have named the file because the code will not work next time if the filename does not end in ".py".

7) Finally, go to the top of the IDLE and click "Run". You will see drop down menu appear. All you need to do then is click "Run Module". The Prime Number Program will now run!
